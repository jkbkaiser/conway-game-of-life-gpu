# Game of Life (CPU + CUDA)

A fast implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in C++ with optional CUDA acceleration. Outputs each frame as an image.

## Build & Run

Requires CUDA Toolkit and G++ (tested on G++ 11.4, Ubuntu 22.04).

```bash
make run        # build and run
make clean      # remove images and binary
```
